# Study Buddy Networking Web App

## About
Started as a Spring 2024 Oasis project, this app is a better alternative to Canvas for connecting with other people in the same class as you.  

By allowing you to specify regularly used contact methods on your profile as a vehicle, it is more likely for you to receive messages since you do not have to check the web app for it. 

You also save time by specifying your availability, what you want in a study buddy, grade, year, and interests on your profile which buddies view before messaging you.
