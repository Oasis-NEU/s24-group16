("CS", 3500, "Object Oriented Design", "Presents a comparative approach to object-oriented programming and design. Discusses the concepts of object, class, meta-class, message, method, inheritance, and genericity. Reviews forms of polymorphism in object-oriented languages. Contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse: forwarding vs. delegation and subclassing vs. subtyping. Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.")
