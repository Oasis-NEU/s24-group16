("CS", 3500, "Object Oriented Design", "Presents a comparative approach to object-oriented programming and design. Discusses the concepts of object, class, meta-class, message, method, inheritance, and genericity. Reviews forms of polymorphism in object-oriented languages. Contrasts the use of inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software reuse: forwarding vs. delegation and subclassing vs. subtyping. Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.");

("PSY", 3240, "Sensation and Perception", "Examines how our sensory organs—eyes, ears, skin, mouth, and nose—along with our sensory nervous system inform our awareness of the outside world and influence our internal perceptual world. Covers perception of light, space, form, motion, color, attention, speech, and music. Topics include visual and auditory perception, neural and anatomical bases, and early and ongoing influences on development of sensation and perception.")

VALUES
("CS", 2500, "Fundamentals of Computer Science 1", "Introduces the fundamental ideas of computing and the principles of programming. Discusses a systematic approach to word problems, including analytic reading, synthesis, goal setting, planning, plan execution, and testing. Presents several models of computing, starting from nothing more than expression evaluation in the spirit of high school algebra. Assumes no prior programming experience; therefore, suitable for first-year students—majors, and nonmajors alike—who wish to explore the intellectual ideas in the discipline.")

("CS", 2510, "Fundamentals of Computer Science 2", "Continues CS 2500. Examines object-oriented programming and associated algorithms using more complex data structures as the focus. Discusses nested structures and nonlinear structures including hash tables, trees, and graphs. Emphasizes abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, recursion, and object-oriented design patterns. Applies these ideas to sample applications that illustrate the breadth of computer science.")

("PHIL", 1300, "Knowledge in a Digital World", "Examines the impact that information technologies (such as the internet, search engines, blogs, wikis, and smartphones); information processing techniques (such as big data analysis, machine learning, crowdsourcing, and cryptography); and information policies (such as privacy norms and speech restrictions) have on what we know and how much we know, as individuals and as a society. The digital world can enhance our ability to acquire knowledge by providing us with fast and cheap access to huge amounts of information. However, it can also undermine our cognitive abilities and provide us with inaccurate or misleading information. Studies normative frameworks from epistemology and ethics (such as epistemic value theory, the extended mind hypothesis, and moral rights) to evaluate these technologies and policies.")
